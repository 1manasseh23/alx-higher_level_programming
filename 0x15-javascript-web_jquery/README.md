#            - How to listen/bind to user events



Certainly! Listening to user events in JavaScript involves attaching event listeners to specific HTML elements. Here’s how you can do it:

Using addEventListener():
The addEventListener() method allows you to attach an event handler to an element. It’s commonly used to listen for user interactions such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.
Syntax: element.addEventListener(event, listener, useCapture);
event: The type of event (e.g., "click", "mousedown", etc.). Events are used without the “on” prefix (e.g., use "click" instead of "onclick").
listener: A JavaScript function that responds to the event occurring.
useCapture: An optional boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling (false) or event capturing (true).
